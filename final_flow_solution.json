For each number, it calculates the complement needed to reach the target sum (i.e., target - current number). It then checks if this complement is already in the dictionary. If it is, the indices for the current number and its complement are the answer. If not, the current number is stored in the dictionary with its index. The dictionary allows us to check for the complement in constant time on average, making the overall time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the list. This approach avoids using nested loops and thus is much more efficient than a brute-force solution.","optimization_suggestions":"1. The current solution is already optimal for time complexity. However, ensure that when you insert elements into the dictionary, you are careful about not reusing the same element twice. This can be managed by checking if the complement exists before inserting the current number into the dictionary.\\n2. In some languages or environments, be cautious about edge cases related to memory usage if the input list is extremely large. Though in Python this is generally not a concern for typical interview problems.\\n3. Another improvement could be adding input validation if the function is to be used in a larger production environment.","interview_tips":"When explaining this solution in an interview, focus on the following points: 1. Explain the logic of looking for a complement (target - current element) and why a dictionary is helpful for O(1) average lookup time. 2. Describe how you can solve the problem in one pass through the array. 3. Emphasize that the approach checks for the complement before inserting the current element to avoid using the same element twice. 4. Discuss the time and space complexity, which are O(n) for both in the average case. 5. Itâ€™s good to mention alternative solutions, such as the brute force method, and explain why the hash table approach is better.","additional_test_cases":"{'input': {'nums': [-3, 4, 3, 90], 'target': 0}, 'expected_output': '[0, 2]', 'explanation': 'This case tests the handling of negative numbers.'}\n{'input': {'nums': [3, 3], 'target': 6}, 'expected_output': '[0, 1]', 'explanation': 'This case involves duplicate numbers where both elements must be used to reach the target.'}\n{'input': {'nums': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 'target': 9}, 'expected_output': '[3, 4]', 'explanation': 'This case tests a typical list where the solution involves selecting non-adjacent elements.'}"},"helper_error":null}
