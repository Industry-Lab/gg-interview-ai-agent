{"status":"success","introduction":"The problem 'Merge Sorted Array' requires merging two sorted arrays into one sorted array in-place. The first array nums1 has enough space at the end to hold the elements of nums2. The challenge is to merge the arrays while maintaining the sorted order without using extra space for another array (if possible). The optimal approach uses a two-pointer technique starting from the ends of both arrays, filling the elements from the back to avoid overwriting any elements in nums1 that have not been checked yet. The reason behind this approach is that if we start from the beginning, we risk overwriting elements in nums1 that have not been processed. With this method, we compare the largest unplaced elements from both arrays, placing the larger of the two in nums1 at the current last available position. This is repeated until all elements from nums2 have been placed into nums1. An alternative approach is to simply copy nums2 elements into nums1 and then sort the entire nums1 array. Although this method is more straightforward, it is not as optimal in terms of time complexity. Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of in-place operations, additional memory usage, and complexity. The following JSON object outlines two approaches: the optimal two-pointer approach and an alternative approach that uses the built-in sort method after merging.","solutions":[{"rank":1,"title":"In-Place Two-Pointer Merge from the End","content":"This approach utilizes two pointers to merge nums1 and nums2 in-place starting from the back. Since both nums1 and nums2 are sorted in non-decreasing order, the largest element will be at the end of each array. We initialize three pointers: one for the end of the actual elements in nums1 (m - 1), one for the end of nums2 (n - 1) and one for filling in the merged array from the end (m + n - 1). During each iteration, we compare the elements pointed to by the first two pointers. We place the larger element at the current last position in nums1, ensuring that we preserve the sorted order. In scenarios where one pointer has already processed all its elements, we continue processing the remaining elements in the other array. Since nums1 already contains the merged elements, if any elements remain in nums2, they are copied over. An important consideration for this approach is that we work backwards to avoid overwriting any useful data in nums1. This approach is optimal because it works in-place and only uses constant extra space, and the time complexity is linear with respect to the total number of elements. The careful management of indices and conditional checks makes sure that every case is handled, even when one of the arrays is empty. The technique shows the strength of the two-pointer method for merging sorted arrays and is a common algorithm technique found in many programming interviews and problems.","time_complexity":"The time complexity is O(m + n) because in the worst case we traverse both arrays from the end towards the start.

The code correctly handles both cases by ensuring that if nums2 still has elements remaining, they are copied over into nums1. Also, if nums1 already contains all larger elements, then the algorithm simply continues to copy elements from nums2. Another edge case is when both arrays are empty, although the constraints typically assume at least enough space in nums1 for nums2. Additionally, the algorithm handles cases where the arrays have duplicate elements.

The idea behind this method is to first copy the valid elements from nums1 and combine them with all elements from nums2 into a temporary list. Since both arrays are sorted individually, merging them directly would work, but leveraging the sorted() function is built for these operations. This approach involves first creating a new list, which concatenates the first m valid elements of nums1 with all n elements of nums2. Once these are combined, the temporary list is sorted using Python’s efficient Timsort algorithm. Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from merge sort and insertion sort, which has good performance on partially sorted arrays. Although this method is not in-place and uses additional memory for the new list, it is conceptually simple and easy to implement. It clearly separates the concerns of merging data and sorting them. Despite the extra space usage, the code remains very concise and easy to understand. It also leverages edge-case handling inherent to Python’s sorting algorithm. This approach might be preferred in scenarios where code clarity and simplicity are valued over optimal space performance. The resulting sorted list is then copied back into nums1 to complete the in-place requirement of the problem. Although this approach may use more time due to the sorting step, it is still a viable and clear method, especially when working with small input sizes or when clarity is prioritized over low-level optimization.","time_complexity":"The time complexity for this approach is dominated by the sorting step, which on average takes O((m+n) log (m+n)) time, where m and n are the number of valid elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively. The concatenation of two lists takes O(m + n) time. Although the overall complexity is higher than the linear solution, for small arrays or cases where clarity is more important than absolute performance, this approach is acceptable.","space_complexity":"The space complexity is O(m + n) because we create a new temporary list that stores all the valid elements from nums1 and every element from nums2.

First, if nums2 is empty, the concatenation step only includes the valid part of nums1, and the sorting does not change the order. Second, if nums1 has no valid elements (m equals 0), the temporary list will only contain elements from nums2, and sorting will simply return nums2 unchanged. Additionally, the approach naturally handles duplicates since the sort function will keep them in place. Although the merge and sort approach uses extra space, this is acceptable in environments where additional space is not a problem. The simplicity of the code minimizes the risk of errors typically associated with pointer manipulation and manual merging, and relies on Python’s well-tested built-ins to handle sorting efficiently.","test_examples":"Test cases for this approach include: Test Case 1 with nums1 = [1,2,3,0,0,0] and nums2 = [2,5,6] should result in [1,2,2,3,5,6].
